#' simulated_MLFA: Simulated data from the MLFA model
#'
#' This dataset contains a list of matrices, each with a specific purpose or
#' structure. The list includes four matrices: \eqn{Y}, \eqn{X}, \eqn{Z}, and \eqn{id}. simulated using the following parameters (described in the simulation study in (Ounajim et al., 2023)):
#'
#' @format A list with four elements:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Y}{the observed outcomes matrix with 10 columns and 500 rows (100 subjects with 5 observations each).}
#'   \item{X}{the fixed effects design matrix with two columns (two explanatory variables for explaining the factor loadings variation) and 500 rows.}
#'   \item{Z}{the random effect design matrix similar to X.}
#'   \item{id}{a vector of length 500 containing subject identifiers}
