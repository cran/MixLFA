Description: Provides a function for the estimation of mixture of longitudinal factor analysis models using the iterative expectation-maximization algorithm (Ounajim, Slaoui, Louis, Billot, Frasca, Rigoard (2023) <doi:10.1002/sim.9804>) and several tools for visualizing and interpreting the models' parameters.
